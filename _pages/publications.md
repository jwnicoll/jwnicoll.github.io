### "Influencing Identities: Creator Identity and Character Representation in Childrenâ€™s Literature"

##### with Anjali Adukia, Emileigh Harrison, and Celia Zhu

#### <strong>Abstract </strong>

<small><em> Books convey messages about social values and norms to children, especially through characters that are personally relevant to them. We quantify representation in books that have won or received honorable mentions from the Newbery, Caldecott, or Coretta Scott King awards. We extend the idea of representation from whether people of diverse groups appear to how they are depicted in a book. Using modern techniques in natural language processing and computer vision, we develop metrics to quantify the presence and portrayal of people of diverse groups in children's books. We apply our metrics to assess how creator identity and award selection criteria influence the supply of representation in children's books. We find that, conditional on the award, books by Black authors depict darker-skinned characters than books by White authors. Additionally, independent of the award, females are increasingly present in female-authored books over time, whereas their relative lack of presence in male-authored books remains somewhat stable across decades. In terms of depiction, we see that females are portrayed in relational to men, whereas men are portrayed in relation to occupations. Surprisingly, this pattern is consistent across author genders. On the demand side, we find that, conditional on the award, Black purchasers are more likely to purchase books by Black authors than White authors.  </em></small>
